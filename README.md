# AyuGram for Android

![AyuGram Logo](.github/AyuGram.png)

## Features

**AyuGram4A** is built on top of exteraGram with reworked patches from Telegraher:

- Built with official keys
- No emulator detection
- Screenshots in secret chats
- Messages history (+ deleted ones)
- No ads
- Probably something else, check commits

...and **ghost mode**.

AyuGram4A does **NOT** include proprietary exteraGram features.

## Why there's no `X` feature from Telegraher?

Because I'm too lazy, and some Telegraher's features are useless for the most of people.

## Want to contribute?

I'd be grateful for any contribution, since I don't really like Java. :)

Work on any feature you want.

## Want to fork?

If you're making a fork, you **should** specify **AyuGram** & **exteraGram** in credits.
Otherwise open source doesn't really work.

Depending on your GitHub profile, we'll decide send an invite to the proprietary repo or not.

And, if you're a kid that don't really want to give credits properly - go and cry writing boilerplate code.

## How to build

1. Clone source code using `git clone https://github.com/AyuGram/AyuGram4A.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio. It should be opened, **not imported**
3. Implement the `AyuMessageUtils` & `AyuHistoryHook` classes. It's not that hard, but if you're
   making your **very** own fork, then you should take some time to write this part of code
4. Create dummy classes for extera's proprietary methods & classes (in `boost` folder)
5. Replace `google-services.json` (we don't want to see crash reports from your app...)
6. Generate application certificate and fill API_KEYS:
   ```
   APP_ID = 6
   APP_HASH = "eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e"
   MAPS_V2_API = NA
   
   SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD = <...>
   SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS = <...>
   SIGNING_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD = <...>
   ```
6. You are ready to compile `AyuGram`

- **AyuGram** can be built with **Android Studio** or from the command line with **Gradle**:

```
./gradlew assembleAfatRelease
```

We have our own [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ayugram).

But since AyuGram is based on **exteraGram**, also join their project
